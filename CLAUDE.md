# Project Tango — Claude Code Context

Time tracking, project budgeting, and invoicing app for The Geospatial Group.
**Read `design-doc.md` in the repo root before making architectural changes — it is the source of truth.**

## Stack (decided — do not substitute)
- .NET 10, ASP.NET Core (single host: MVC/Razor UI + `/api/v1` REST controllers)
- Bootstrap 5.3.x (latest) for all UI
- PostgreSQL via **Dapper + Npgsql — NO EF Core / no ORM**. Schema is versioned as plain SQL scripts run by DbUp (embedded resources in `Infrastructure/Persistence/Scripts/`, journaled in `schemaversions`). Apply with `dotnet run --project src/ProjectTango.Web -- migrate`; Development auto-migrates on startup (`Database:MigrateOnStartup`). Local dev DB: native PostgreSQL on 5432 (docker-compose fallback on 5433)
- Auth: Microsoft Entra ID, single tenant (thegeospatialgroup.com), Microsoft.Identity.Web (cookies for UI, JWT bearer for API)
- Excel import: ClosedXML. PDF generation: QuestPDF
- Hosting target: AWS (ECS Fargate, RDS PostgreSQL, S3, SQS)
- Tests: xUnit; integration tests use Testcontainers Postgres

## Domain rules that must never be violated
1. Money is `numeric`/`decimal`, never float. Timestamps UTC. USD only. Tax column exists but is always 0 in v1.
2. Rates live on `project_rate_cards` (project + billing role + effective dates). Rate changes create new effective-dated rows — never update in place. Invoice lines snapshot the rate permanently. No overtime multipliers.
3. An employee's company roles (permissions) are many-to-many via `employee_roles`; permissions are the UNION of held roles. The **billing role is chosen per time entry** (`time_entries.billing_role_id`); `project_assignments.default_billing_role_id` is a UI default only. Rate resolution: (project, entry's billing role, entry date).
4. Admin role bypasses resource-level checks; every Admin override is audit-logged. Last remaining Admin cannot remove their own Admin role.
5. Time entries: open → approved → invoiced (NO submission step). **Entries auto-approve on save** (small-shop default): a billable entry approves as soon as a rate card covers its (project, billing role, date), otherwise it stays `open` until one is added; non-billable time always approves. The owner edits freely — including back-dating forgotten days — until the semi-monthly `timesheet_periods` window is closed or the entry is invoiced (approval no longer locks owner edits). Ops/Admin closing the window locks owner edits (close/reopen audited). The manual approval path (ApprovalService — adjust `hours_billed`, un-approve) stays available for when it's wanted. Invoiced is never editable — void the invoice instead (only `issued` invoices can be voided, never `paid`; voiding returns entries to `approved`).
6. Entries carry `hours_worked` and `hours_billed`. `hours_billed` defaults to worked and may be adjusted ONLY by an approver (approval is a billing decision — worked 8, bill 6); with auto-approval that adjustment means an Ops/PM un-approve + re-approve via ApprovalService. `hours_worked` is only ever set by the owner.
7. A time entry requires an active project assignment for that employee.
8. Fixed-fee projects bill via project-level `milestones` (planned → ready_to_bill → billed, milestone amount not hours). Entries optionally attach to a milestone; unattached entries on fixed-fee projects are out-of-scope and bill hourly at their own rate.
9. Projects are NEVER auto-closed by budget exhaustion. Overrun is allowed and flagged. Close-out is an explicit audited action; closed projects block new time but remain reportable and invoiceable (WIP). Ops/Admin can reopen.
10. Invoice numbers (INV-YYYY-NNNN) are never reused; NNNN runs continuously across years (no annual reset); voided invoices keep their number.
11. Nothing is hard-deleted: soft deletes / status changes only. Audit log on financial and permission mutations.
12. Authorization is enforced in the API/service layer, never only in views.
13. Employees include W-2 staff and 1099 subcontractors (`employees.employment_type`); both log time identically and appear in per-person reporting. Employee records may exist before Entra sign-in (`entra_oid` null, matched by tenant email).

## Seed data
- `dwoods@thegeospatialgroup.com` seeded as initial Admin (matched by Entra `oid` after first sign-in; email as bootstrap key).
- Roles: Developer, Project Manager, Operations Manager, Admin (Admin: is_billable=false, is_system_admin=true).
- New tenant users get NO roles until granted.
- Internal client **The Geospatial Group** with internal non-billable projects (e.g., `INT-LEAVE`) for leave/admin time — never invoiced.
- `company_holidays` table: admin-managed holiday calendar.

## Time entry cadence
Monthly timesheet grid (projects × days, mirrors the Excel workbook). No submission: employees record time as they go and edit until Ops/Admin closes the semi-monthly window (`timesheet_periods`: 1st–15th, 16th–EOM). Billing role selected per entry; on fixed-fee projects entries optionally attach to a milestone.

## Excel timesheet import (Phase 2)
Company workbook format (see design-doc.md §6.6; sample at `Samples/2026 Don Woods timesheet.xlsx`): `Yearly Info` sheet (employee, year, job list, holidays); two sheets per month — the calendar sheet JAN–DEC where hours are entered (project rows × day columns, leave rows, totals) and the paired `*-DESC` sheet that receives those hours rolled up and holds the typed per-project-per-day work descriptions. Hours are authoritative on the calendar, descriptions on `-DESC` (join by project+date, warn on mismatch). Extra client-specific calendars (e.g., `'JAN '` vs `'JAN'`, "For MDEQ") are derived and skipped. Parser must skip #REF!/#VALUE! artifacts and zero rows; dedupe on employee+date+project; map spreadsheet labels to projects with saved mappings; importer supplies each person's tenant email (creates employee record if missing, entra_oid linked on first sign-in); leave rows land in internal projects; commit as approved entries with import_id; support rollback until invoiced.

## Roadmap
Phase 1 (now): scaffold solution, Entra auth, employees/roles, clients, projects, rate cards, assignments, time entry + approval, project dashboard.
Phase 2: budgets + alerts, invoicing + PDF, WIP report, Excel import, close-out/reopen.
Phase 3: reporting suite, exports, utilization, forecasting.
Phase 4: mobile/desktop clients against /api/v1, accounting integration.

## Conventions
- API: versioned `/api/v1`, cursor pagination, RFC 7807 problem+json errors, idempotency keys on invoice issuance, OpenAPI generated from code.
- Database: snake_case tables/columns, uuid PKs, enums as text + CHECK constraints. Schema changes are a NEW numbered DbUp script — never edit a script that has shipped.
- Dapper: `DefaultTypeMap.MatchNamesWithUnderscores = true` (set in AddInfrastructure). Email lookups must cast the parameter (`email = @email::citext`) — a text-typed parameter degrades citext equality to case-sensitive. Repositories live in Infrastructure and implement Application interfaces.
- Seeded well-known ids (roles, bootstrap Admin, internal client, INT-LEAVE) live in `Infrastructure/Persistence/SeedData.cs` and must match `0002_seed_phase1.sql`.
- Every feature: service-layer logic + unit tests; controllers thin.
- Bootstrap components only — no other CSS frameworks.
